    <p>This apple cider chicken could not be simpler or more delicious. Chicken breasts cook first in sage-infused butter, then return to a sweet-sour pan sauce of reduced apple cider and vinegar.
        The pan sauce is then finished to glistening perfection in the classic French style with a chunk of cold butter.

    <h3>How to Make Apple Cider Chicken Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade Apple Cider Chicken sat:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat; add sage leaves and fry until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove and reserve.</li>
        <li>Add chicken breasts to the same skillet, and cook until just cooked through, about 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate and cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Add shallots to the skillet; saut√© for 1 minute. Pour in cider and vinegar, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. 
            Cook until reduced by half, which will only take a few minutes. Reduce heat to low and place chicken back in, along with any accumulated juices from the plate. 
            Cook for a few minutes, turning occasionally, and basting with the hot sauce until the chicken is hot.
